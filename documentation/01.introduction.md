Named Cascading Style Sheets is a naming convention and guideline for semantic `CSS`.


Why
---

Massive `CSS` used to be a nightmare while working on projects with different kinds of developers. The lack of conventions and guidelines are going to lead to a unmaintainable ball of mud.


Goal
----

A predictable grammar for `CSS` that provides semantic information about the `HTML` template.

- What tags, components and sections are affected
- What is the relation of one class to another
